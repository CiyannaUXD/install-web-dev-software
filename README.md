# Mac OS Web Development Software Installer
The enclosed script installs Mac-based HTML-, CSS-, Sass-, and JavaScript-related software and configuration files for any web development course you take with me. To run the script:

1. **Open The Terminal**: Perform a Spotlight search by typing `⌘` + `spacebar` and entering “The Terminal”
2. **Navigate to The Root of This Repo**: With The Terminal open, type `cd` followed by a space, then drag the folder icon to the left of `install-web-dev-softare` in the title bar of this repo into The Terminal window. Hit `return`
3. **Run The Installer**: Type `./install.sh`
